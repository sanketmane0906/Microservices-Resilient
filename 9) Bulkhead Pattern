Bulkhead Pattern :- 

Purpose:

  Isolates and limits the impact of failures or high loads from one component to another.
  Prevents a single failing component from affecting the entire system.

Benefits:

  Increases system resilience by containing failures.
  Ensures high availability of critical services.
  Helps in handling high loads efficiently.
  
Analogy:

  Named after bulkheads in ships, which compartmentalize sections to prevent flooding from sinking the entire vessel.
  
Implementation Approaches:

  Separate Thread Pools: Assigning different thread pools for different services to prevent resource starvation.
  Service Segmentation: Dividing microservices into different groups based on importance.
  Database Partitioning: Using different databases or database instances for different workloads.
  
Use Cases:

  Microservices Architecture: Prevents one overloaded service from crashing others.
  Cloud-based Systems: Ensures smooth scaling and service isolation.
  High Traffic Applications: Protects critical functionalities from failure due to unexpected spikes in traffic.
