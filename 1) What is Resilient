Resilient :- 

    Resilience means that a system is capable of withstanding tough times and bouncing back. If any performance or network issues occur, the system should remain stable and recover effectively.

    Resilient means being able to recover quickly from difficulties or adapt well to change. It can refer to people, materials, or systems.

      Examples:
          A resilient person stays strong and bounces back after facing challenges.
          A resilient material returns to its original shape after being bent or stretched.
          A resilient system keeps working despite disruptions.
