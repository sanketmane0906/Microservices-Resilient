What is Circuit Breaker Pattern 

  The Circuit Breaker pattern helps to stop cascading failures.
  In a microservices architecture, temporary issues such as network failures may occur.
  When such issues arise, the Circuit Breaker pattern helps prevent cascading failures.

  It monitors all remote calls, and if any microservice responds slowly, the Circuit Breaker will terminate that call.
  It continuously monitors all remote calls, and if enough calls fail, the Circuit Breaker mechanism activates.
  When triggered, it immediately returns a failure response to the client.

  This mechanism provides enough time for the defective microservice to recover while blocking all traffic to that faulty service during the recovery period.

  Advantages:
      Fail Fast
      Fail Gracefully
      Recover Seamlessly
