Three States of the Circuit Breaker :-

  To implement the Circuit Breaker pattern, we need to configure its states properly.

  1) Closed State:
    In the Closed state, the Circuit Breaker allows all incoming requests to reach the microservice.
  
  2) Open State:
    If the Circuit Breaker detects that most requests are failing, it changes its state to Open.
    In this state, it stops forwarding requests to the faulty microservice to prevent further failures.
    
  3) Half-Open State:
    The Circuit Breaker remains in the Open state for a specified period.
    After this period, it transitions to the Half-Open state, where it allows a limited number of test requests to check if the issue is resolved.
    Based on the results:
    If the service is healthy, the Circuit Breaker moves back to the Closed state.
    If failures persist, it switches back to the Open state.
